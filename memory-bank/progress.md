# Progress

## What Works
- Basic project structure is set up
- Main entry point (main.go) is implemented
- CUI handler with basic flag parsing is working
- Logging configuration is implemented
- Development container setup is working

## What's Left to Build
- [ ] Domain models
- [ ] Infrastructure components
  - [ ] File operations
  - [ ] Database operations
  - [ ] API operations
- [ ] Use cases with business logic
- [ ] Controllers
- [ ] Enhanced CUI handler
- [ ] API handler
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Documentation and examples

## Current Status
**Project Phase**: Initial Setup

The project is currently in its initial setup phase. The basic structure is in place, but most of the functionality is yet to be implemented. The current implementation only includes:

1. A main.go file that sets up logging and calls the CUI handler
2. A basic CUI handler that parses a verbose flag
3. Directory structure following clean architecture principles

## Known Issues
- No domain models are defined yet
- No business logic is implemented
- No database integration is implemented
- CUI handler only supports a verbose flag
- No API handler is implemented
- No unit tests are written

## Recent Milestones
- ✅ Set up basic project structure
- ✅ Implement main entry point
- ✅ Create basic CUI handler
- ✅ Configure logging

## Next Milestones
- Define domain models
- Implement SQLite database operations
- Develop core business logic
- Enhance CUI handler with more commands
- Implement API handler
