# Progress

## What Works
- Basic project structure is set up
- Main entry point (main.go) is implemented
- CUI handler with basic flag parsing is working
- Logging configuration is implemented
- Development container setup is working
- Initial domain models for stock prices are defined

## What's Left to Build
- [x] Initial domain models
- [ ] Additional domain models
- [ ] Infrastructure components
  - [ ] File operations
  - [ ] Database operations
  - [ ] API operations
- [ ] Use cases with business logic
- [ ] Controllers
- [ ] Enhanced CUI handler
- [ ] API handler
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Documentation and examples

## Current Status
**Project Phase**: Initial Setup

The project is currently in its initial setup phase. The basic structure is in place, but most of the functionality is yet to be implemented. The current implementation includes:

1. A main.go file that sets up logging and calls the CUI handler
2. A basic CUI handler that parses a verbose flag
3. Directory structure following clean architecture principles
4. Initial domain models for stock prices (StockPrice and DailyStockPrice)

## Known Issues
- Only basic stock price domain models are defined
- No business logic is implemented
- No database integration is implemented
- CUI handler only supports a verbose flag
- No API handler is implemented
- No unit tests are written

## Recent Milestones
- ✅ Set up basic project structure
- ✅ Implement main entry point
- ✅ Create basic CUI handler
- ✅ Configure logging
- ✅ Define initial domain models

## Next Milestones
- Define additional domain models
- Implement SQLite database operations for stock data
- Develop core business logic for stock price operations
- Enhance CUI handler with stock-related commands
- Implement API handler for stock data access
