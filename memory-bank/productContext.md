# Product Context

## Purpose
This project serves as a template repository for creating CLI tools in Golang with SQLite integration. It provides a structured foundation that follows clean architecture principles, making it easier to develop maintainable and testable applications.

## Problems Solved
- **Standardization**: Provides a consistent structure for Golang CLI applications
- **Architecture**: Implements clean architecture patterns to separate concerns
- **Database Integration**: Includes SQLite integration for local data storage
- **Multiple Interfaces**: Supports both command-line and API interfaces
- **Testing**: Includes a testing framework and guidelines

## Intended Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. Replace "sqlite-playground" with the actual project name
3. Develop within the provided architecture
4. Build for target platforms (Linux/Windows)

## User Experience Goals
- **Developers**:
  - Clear architecture to follow
  - Consistent code organization
  - Well-defined interfaces between layers
  - Easy to test and maintain

- **End Users**:
  - Intuitive command-line interface
  - Clear help documentation
  - Consistent behavior across platforms
  - Optional API interface for integration with other systems

## Key Stakeholders
- Developers using this template for their Golang CLI applications
- End users of the applications built with this template
